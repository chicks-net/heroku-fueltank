Heroku Fueltank
===============

Heroku app to try [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us/) that takes fuel tank levels and guesses how long you will still have heat.

It is easy to figure out the filled volume of a cylinder on its end, but it is not easy to do with a
cylinder on its side as is typical with most fuel tanks:

* [Doctor Byron](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56455.html) was the only place I could find
that was informative enough for me to figure out the inches to gallons conversion in a spreadsheet.
I know I could have done this with Calculus, but since I haven't needed that for 20 years why break
my record?
